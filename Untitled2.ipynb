    "With a sample size of 30, the degrees of freedom (df) are n - 1 = 29. Looking up the critical value for a two-tailed t-test with α = 0.10 and df = 29, we find it to be approximately ±1.699.\n",

    "The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as the one calculated (t = 0.23) if the null hypothesis is true. The p-value can be obtained using statistical software or a t-distribution table.\n",

    "Step 5: Make a decision:\n",
    "If the calculated test statistic (t = 0.23) falls outside the critical value range (-1.699 to 1.699) or if the p-value is less than the significance level (0.10), we reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",

    "Based on the calculated test statistic and the critical value, we can conclude that there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. This means that, at the 10% significance level, we do not have enough evidence to support that caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time."
